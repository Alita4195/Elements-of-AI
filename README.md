# Elements-of-AI
Solving the test in the courses.<br>
## Chapter 1 Getting started with AI
### section 1<br>
Factorial e.g. 4*3*2=24<br>
By going through all the possible routes and find the most optimized one. This is using "brute-force". When the number of solutions grow large, then we need smarter techniques.<br>
### section 2<br>
we can find local summit or local optima, but we aim for global optimum.<br>
Greedy solutions/simulated annealing<br>
prob = exp(-(S_old - S_new)/T)<br>
As (S_old - S_new)/T increases, the probability is degreasing. 
## Chapter 2 Dealing with uncertainty
Conditional probabilities
